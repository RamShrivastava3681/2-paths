# WH-TECH-01 — WHIZUNIK COMMAND — The Executive Control System — Product & Module Register

**Version:** 1.0
**Type:** Day 1 — Existing Product Inventory & Module Register (evidence-based)
**Source:** Deep-dive inspection of the repository (frontend, backend, database layer, configuration, deployment, documentation)
**Date:** 2026-08-17
**Status:** Draft for Sankalp review

---

## 1. Document Purpose

This register documents the **current, actually-implemented** WHIZUNIK COMMAND product and classifies every verified module/feature for standardisation and reusability. It is an inventory exercise only:

- No new functionality was developed.
- No code was refactored or modified.
- No architectural decisions were made.
- Nothing is documented as implemented unless it could be verified from source code, UI routes, API routes, database models, configuration, deployment files, or documentation.
- Items that could not be verified are explicitly marked **Unknown / Partially Verified / Needs Review**.

Day 2 activities (architecture documentation, technical debt analysis, security assessment, Intelligence Engine architecture) are **out of scope** for this document.

## 2. Product Overview (verified functionality only)

WHIZUNIK COMMAND ("The Executive Control System") is a web platform with two distinct business workflows implemented in one codebase:

1. **Receivables factoring & monitoring** (the platform's original positioning — the public landing page is titled *"WHIZUNIK COMMAND — Receivables factoring & monitoring"*): invoice submission, checker approval, treasury funding queue, advances against receivables, debtor master, invoice reminders, Notice of Assignment (NOA) emails, ageing/portfolio dashboards.
2. **Goods trading lifecycle** (built out most recently, branded internally as the *"WHIZUNIK COMMAND Goods Platform"*): product catalogue, quotations, sales orders, purchase orders, goods receipts (GRN), dispatch notes, inventory stock movements, and a demand-forecasting + pricing-recommendation engine.

Both workflows share one platform: a React 19 SPA (TanStack Router/Query, Tailwind v4, shadcn/Radix UI, Recharts) calling an Express 4 + TypeScript API, backed by a **single-table DynamoDB design** (GSI1 client-scoped, GSI2 entity-scoped) with S3 for file storage and Nodemailer for transactional email. Auth is JWT in an httpOnly SameSite=Strict cookie with role-based access control (7 roles).

**Naming discrepancy (recorded, not resolved):** the product appears under three names — **WHIZUNIK COMMAND** (public brand + theme key `whizunik-theme`), **Insight Factor** (server logs, email templates, admin account, repo/package name, DynamoDB table default `InsightFactor`), and **Two Paths** (deployment domain `demo.whizunikhub.com`, NOA email branding, seed data, documentation and PPT decks) — plus **Globalor**, which is referenced in the product brief as the **planned target client/brand** for the standardised product but has **zero code references** (see §5 and §8). See §8 and §10.

## 3. Product Module Register

Legend — Status: **Live** / **Testing** / **Development** / **Needs Review** (exactly one; runtime status cannot be verified from the repo, so most rows are "Needs Review" with the deployment evidence noted). Classification: **CORE** / **CONFIGURABLE** / **OPTIONAL MODULE** / **CLIENT-SPECIFIC** / **Needs Sankalp Review** (with rationale).

- Document uploader + list (`components/document-uploader.tsx`), signed-image hook (`lib/s3-image.ts`), product thumbnails, skeletons.
- Theme (light/dark/system, `lib/theme.tsx`), command palette (Cmd+K), responsive mobile nav.
- Backend field-transform middleware: request snake_case→camelCase, response camelCase→snake_case (`middleware/transform.ts`) — every frontend type uses snake_case.

## 5. Client-Specific Functionality

**Globalor — planned client (not in code).** A repository-wide search for "Globalor" (case-insensitive) returned **zero matches** across code, configuration, deployment files, slide decks and assets — the brand actually rendered across the frontend is **WHIZUNIK COMMAND** (page titles, sidebar, auth page, logo alt). Per the product brief, Globalor is understood to be a **planned client/brand** for the standardised product. No Globalor module, workflow, terminology, dashboard, report, rule or integration exists in this repository — **status requires Sankalp confirmation** (§8 Q1).

**Retail — no client-specific implementation found.** "Retail" appears only in (a) the MRP field description ("max retail price") and (b) demo/seed company names (e.g. "MetroMart Retail Pvt Ltd", "Khan Retailers", "Menon Retail Group" in `scripts/seed-crm-demo.ts`) and slide decks. No retail-specific business logic exists.

| # | Client | Functionality | Why client-specific | Reusable? | Evidence | Sankalp recommendation |
|---|--------|---------------|---------------------|-----------|----------|------------------------|
| C1 | Two Paths | NOA email branding hard-coded to `"Two Paths"` in the send-NOA route, while every other email/PDF resolves the company name from the user record | Hard-coded constant in business logic (`const companyName = "Two Paths";` in `routes/index.ts`) | Yes — move to the per-client invoice template / user profile (module 26 is already the natural home) | `backend/src/routes/index.ts` (send-noa) | Confirm Two Paths is a client brand; approve moving branding into the configurable template |
| C2 | Two Paths | Demo/seed datasets branded with Two Paths SKUs (`TP-RC-001` "Two Paths Trail Rain Cover", etc.) and WHIZUNIK COMMAND demo accounts | Scripts `seed-sku-movements.ts`, `seed-forecast-demo.ts`, `seed-crm-demo.ts` are Two Paths-specific; scripts write to the **real DynamoDB table** per their headers | Partially — the scripts are generic scaffolding, the data is not | `backend/scripts/*.ts` | Confirm whether demo data has leaked into production data; decide whether to keep/remove seed scripts |
| C3 | Two Paths | Deployment/branding: `demo.whizunikhub.com` in nginx config, PM2 app name `twopaths-backend`, `CORS_ORIGIN`, `DEPLOY.md`, PPT decks | Infrastructure + docs targeted at one tenant domain | Yes — parametrise domain/branding for multi-tenant deployment | `deploy/nginx.conf`, `ecosystem.config.cjs`, `backend/.env.example`, `DEPLOY.md`, `ppt-generator/` | Confirm production topology (single-tenant vs multi-tenant); see §8 Q4 |
| C4 | Globalor | **Planned client per the product brief; not implemented** — repo-wide search returns zero matches; the frontend renders "WHIZUNIK COMMAND" | Brief-referenced only (see §2) | N/A until onboarding starts | repo-wide search (zero matches); `frontend/src/routes/*` (WHIZUNIK COMMAND branding) | Confirm Globalor onboarding timeline and target modules |

**No whole module was classified CLIENT-SPECIFIC** — the Two Paths-specific code is confined to branding constants, seed data, and deployment config. All goods/inventory modules are generic (client-scoped via `clientId`) and classified OPTIONAL MODULE pending Sankalp's product decision.

## 6. Reusability Opportunities

| Opportunity | Today | Could become | Evidence | Effort estimate (qualitative) |
|-------------|-------|--------------|----------|-------------------------------|
| Invoice/document branding (colors, logo, tax id, terms, bank details) | Per-client `InvoiceTemplate` used by browser print only | **CONFIGURABLE core** — also feed the emailed PDFs (document-pdf + NOA) so server emails match the client template | `app.template.tsx`, `components/invoice-print.tsx`, `lib/document-pdf.ts`, `routes/index.ts` (NOA hard-codes Two Paths) | Low — one shared data source, two consumers |
| Reminder thresholds `[15,7,2,1,0]` | Hard-coded | **CONFIGURABLE** — per-client reminder cadence | `invoice-reminder.ts` | Low |
| Default advance rate (0.80) & fee rate (0.025) | Model defaults | **CONFIGURABLE** — per-client defaults | `models/invoice.ts`, `models/purchase-invoice.ts` | Low |
| Currency | Fields exist (CoA, proforma) but emails/PDFs hard-code USD/$ | **CONFIGURABLE** — honour the stored currency everywhere | `email.ts`, `lib/document-pdf.ts`, `models/*.ts` | Medium (touch all money formatting) |
| Alert generation | Manual admin trigger only | **CORE automated** — scheduled overdue/risk alert generation | `routes/index.ts` (alerts), `invoice-reminder.ts` (scheduler pattern to reuse) | Low–Medium |
| Goods lifecycle (catalogue → PO → GRN, quotation → SO → dispatch → invoice) | Implemented, Two Paths-driven | **Optional reusable module** for any distribution/retail customer | `models/goods-*.ts`, `COMPLETE-WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md` | Already built — packaging/documentation effort |
| Forecasting + pricing engine | Implemented; duplicated FE/BE copies | **Core differentiator / optional module** — decision needed (see §8 Q6) | `lib/forecast-engine.ts` (×2), `services/forecast-service.ts` | Already built |
| CRM, Submissions/Workspace, View-As, NOA, Approvals | Implemented, partly demo-seeded | **Optional modules** with per-client enablement (feature flags don't exist yet) | see §3 modules 28–33 | Packaging/config effort |
| `Vendor` (legacy) + `Supplier` masters | Two models merged in UI | **Single Supplier master**, migrate Vendor data | `models/vendor.ts`, `models/supplier.ts`, `routes/index.ts` | Medium (data migration) — refactor, out of Day 1 scope |

---

## 7. Duplicated Functionality

Recorded for awareness only — **not fixed**.

| # | Duplicated functionality | Locations | Apparent reason | Possible common capability | Needs review? |
|---|--------------------------|-----------|-----------------|----------------------------|---------------|
| D1 | **Forecast engine kept in two identical copies** (explicit "KEEP IN SYNC" comment) | `backend/src/lib/forecast-engine.ts` vs `frontend/src/lib/forecast-engine.ts` | Server computes/persists; client renders live — same logic shipped twice | Single shared package/module | Yes — risk of drift; sync comment already warns |
| D2 | **Two supplier-side masters**: `Supplier` (new, global) and `Vendor` (legacy, client-scoped) | `models/supplier.ts`, `models/vendor.ts`; merged in every procurement dropdown; purchase invoices/POs can reference either | Migration from legacy Vendor to Supplier model | Single supplier master | Yes |
| D3 | **Two "purchase order" concepts**: `PurchaseOrder` (proforma/funding) vs `GoodsPurchaseOrder` (catalogue PO) | `models/purchase-order.ts`, `models/goods-purchase-order.ts` | Deliberate split (funding vs goods) but names collide | Clearer naming/namespacing | Yes — naming review |
| D4 | **Balance sheet implemented twice**: as a tab in `/app/accounting` and as a standalone `/app/balance-sheet` route (both fetch CoA+invoices+PIs+advances+stock+journals+expenses) | `frontend/src/routes/app.accounting.tsx`, `frontend/src/routes/app.balance-sheet.tsx` | Two-page build-out of the same report | One report component | Yes |
| D5 | **Parallel aggregation paths**: `/dashboard` API, `/user-progress` API, dashboard page KPIs, reporting page, and balance-sheet all recompute totals independently | `routes/index.ts` (dashboard, user-progress), `app.dashboard.tsx`, `app.reporting.tsx`, `app.balance-sheet.tsx` | No shared analytics/query layer | Shared metrics service | Yes — metric drift risk |
| D6 | **Two invoice line/amount structures** on the Invoice model: legacy `lineItems`/`subtotal`/`taxRate`/`taxAmount` alongside new `lines`/`subtotalGoods`/`gstTotal`/`grandTotal` | `models/invoice.ts` | Migration in progress; emails still read legacy fields | Single canonical line/totals shape | Yes |
| D7 | **Two PDF/print pipelines**: backend `document-pdf.ts` (emailed PDFs) vs frontend `invoice-print.tsx` PrintShell (browser print) | `backend/src/lib/document-pdf.ts`, `frontend/src/components/invoice-print.tsx` | Different contexts (attachment vs print) | Shared document renderer (or server-rendered HTML→PDF) | Yes |
| D8 | **Reminder triggers in multiple places**: hourly scheduler + instant triggers inside invoice/purchase-invoice create/update handlers | `invoice-reminder.ts` + `routes/index.ts` (several `sendReminderForInvoice` call sites) | Responsiveness (instant) + batch (scheduler) | Single reminder dispatch service with dedupe | Low risk; verify dedupe holds |
| D9 | **Stock balance / inventory value computed several ways**: dashboard sums only `direction==="in"` (no debits), balance sheet and forecast compute confirmed in−out | `routes/index.ts` (dashboard), `app.dashboard.tsx`, `app.balance-sheet.tsx`, `forecast-service.ts` | Different definitions per consumer | Single stock-valuation helper | Yes — numbers can disagree |

## 8. Items Requiring Sankalp Review

1. **Q1 — "Globalor":** referenced in the product brief as a **planned client/brand**, but a repository-wide search returns **zero matches** — the brand actually rendered in the frontend is **WHIZUNIK COMMAND**. Is Globalor a planned client to onboard, a separate codebase, or an error in the brief?
2. **Q2 — Product naming:** the platform is simultaneously "WHIZUNIK COMMAND" (public brand), "Insight Factor" (legacy product/API/admin/DynamoDB default), and "Two Paths" (deployment domain + NOA branding + docs). Which is the official product name for the register and future branding?
3. **Q3 — Two Paths status:** is Two Paths a live production tenant, a demo, or the seed client? Should the register treat the goods lifecycle as "built for Two Paths" or "built for WHIZUNIK COMMAND generally"?
4. **Q4 — Deployment topology:** production config targets a single domain (`demo.whizunikhub.com`) with a single DynamoDB table and per-user `clientId` scoping. Is the intended model **single-tenant per install**, **multi-tenant shared**, or **per-client forks**? This determines how much of the CLIENT-SPECIFIC items become CONFIGURABLE.
5. **Q5 — Status (Live/Testing/Development):** deployment artifacts exist (PM2, nginx, Let's Encrypt paths) but runtime status cannot be verified from the repo. Sankalp must confirm which modules are live in production, in testing, or in development.
6. **Q6 — Forecasting & pricing engine:** is this the flagship **CORE** differentiator (marketing, PPTs and formula docs suggest yes) or an **OPTIONAL MODULE** for goods clients? Classification affects everything downstream.
7. **Q7 — Alerts automation:** alert *generation* is only manual (admin button). Is automated alert generation (like the reminder scheduler) planned/required?
8. **Q8 — Accounting integration depth:** the accounting page claims "every financial movement becomes a balanced journal," but journals are currently **manual only** — invoices, payments, GRNs and dispatches do not auto-post entries. Is this the intended state (manual bookkeeping) or a gap?
9. **Q9 — Currency/region:** GSTIN/HSN fields (India) coexist with default currency USD and `$` formatting in emails/PDFs. What are the target currencies/regions for the common product?
10. **Q10 — Debtor scoping:** Debtors are global (no `clientId`) while Products, Vendors, Invoices, etc. are client-scoped. Intentional (shared debtor book across clients) or an inconsistency?
11. **Q11 — Vendor vs Supplier:** legacy `Vendor` + new `Supplier` — is consolidation planned?
12. **Q12 — CRM and Submissions demo data:** only seeded demo data exists (including `sankalp@whizunik.com` and `ram@gmail.com` accounts writing to the real table). Are these features production-active, and should seed scripts be removed/guarded?
13. **Q13 — Duplication:** are D1–D9 (incl. the dual balance-sheet routes and dual invoice-line structures) intentional migration states or debt to schedule?
14. **Q14 — Naming collision:** `PurchaseOrder` (proforma) vs `GoodsPurchaseOrder` — confirm the product terminology going forward.
15. **Q15 — Planned vs implemented:** several prompt-listed concepts (Intelligence Engine, pricing *recommendations* applied automatically) are **not implemented**; Globalor is planned-client branding only (§5) — confirm none of these are expected to be documented as present.
16. **Q16 — Multi-client dashboards:** `scope=all` lists expose all clients' invoices/PIs/expenses to the shared dashboard. Is cross-client visibility intended for all roles, or should it be restricted?

## 10. Limitations / Unknowns

1. **Runtime status unverifiable:** nothing in the repo proves which environment is live. Status is "Needs Review" everywhere; deployment artifacts (PM2, nginx, env examples) are the only evidence.
2. **Globalor:** zero code references; treated as a **planned client/brand** referenced in the product brief only, not implemented (see §5).
3. **Database contents:** DynamoDB is single-table with no schema/migration files; the register documents the *models'* shape, not the actual data. Seed scripts suggest real-table demo data exists but that cannot be confirmed from code.
4. **Intelligence Engine:** the prompt mentions a future Intelligence Engine — **not implemented**; the closest verified capability is the deterministic forecast/pricing engine (module 31).
5. **Secrets:** env values and credentials were not read/exported; only `.env.example` keys and config shapes are referenced.
6. **Frontend UI verification:** routes/pages were inventoried from source; no browser walkthrough was performed.
7. **Feature counts are approximate:** features were tallied from the deep-dive; a few lists may be ±5.
8. **Reports nuance:** `/app/reporting` (sales/purchase/ageing report cards) and `/app/reports` (reporting-manager team view) are distinct pages; their product relationship is unclear (see §8).
9. **Route orphans:** `/app/vendors` and `/app/accounting` exist as routes but do not appear in the admin sidebar (suppliers + balance-sheet are surfaced instead) — legacy entry points retained.

---

## 11. Executive Summary

1. **Total modules discovered:** 34 (18 Core, 2 Configurable, 14 Optional).
2. **Total major features discovered:** ≈260 verified in code.
3. **Core count:** 18 modules (auth/RBAC, dashboard, masters, invoices AR/AP, expenses, advances, alerts, audit, reminders, CoA, journals, credit/debit notes, balance sheet, file storage, public pages).
4. **Configurable count:** 2 modules (catalogue settings, invoice/document templates) — with 4 more strong candidates listed in §6.
5. **Optional Module count:** 14 (goods catalogue/inventory/PO/GRN/quotation/SO/dispatch, proformas/funding, CRM, submissions, view-as, forecasting, NOA, approvals).
6. **Client-Specific count:** 0 modules; 3 items (Two Paths NOA branding hard-coded in a route, Two Paths seed/demo data, Two Paths deployment config). **Globalor is a planned client per the product brief — zero code references exist; the brand actually rendered is WHIZUNIK COMMAND.**
7. **Items requiring Sankalp review:** 16 questions (§8).
8. **Major reusable opportunities:** per-client document branding for all outputs (incl. emailed PDFs), configurable reminder thresholds/advance rates, automated alert generation, the already-built goods lifecycle as a reusable optional module, and the forecast/pricing engine as a potential core differentiator.
9. **Major client-specific functionality:** hard-coded "Two Paths" NOA branding (C1); Two Paths-branded demo seeds writing to the real table (C2); demo.whizunikhub.com deployment (C3).
10. **Major uncertainties:** product naming (WHIZUNIK COMMAND vs Insight Factor vs Two Paths vs planned Globalor); production status; single- vs multi-tenant; Globalor onboarding (planned, not in code); whether forecasting is core or optional; accounting depth (manual journals only); currency/region; debtor scoping; alert automation.

---

## 12. Recommended Discussion Agenda With Sankalp

1. **Naming & identity** (Q2, Q3): WHIZUNIK COMMAND vs Insight Factor vs Two Paths — official name, and whether Two Paths is a client or the seed tenant.
2. **Globalor** (Q1): confirm Globalor is a planned client to onboard (per the brief) and the target timeline — note zero code references exist today.
3. **Production status** (Q5): which modules are Live/Testing/Development today.
4. **Deployment topology** (Q4, Q16): single-tenant vs multi-tenant; whether `scope=all` cross-client dashboards are intended.
5. **Forecast/pricing engine positioning** (Q6): Core differentiator vs optional module.
6. **Branding/configurability approvals** (C1, §6): move NOA branding to the template; approve configurable reminder cadence, advance/fee defaults, currency handling.
7. **Data hygiene** (Q12, C2): demo seed data in the real table — cleanup decision.
8. **Duplication triage** (D1–D9, Q11, Q13, Q14): confirm which duplicates are intentional migration states vs debt (no fixes in Day 1).
9. **Accounting depth** (Q8, Q9): manual-journals-only vs auto-posting; target currency/region.
10. **Alert automation** (Q7) and **debtor scoping** (Q10).
